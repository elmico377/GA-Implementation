# Genetic Algorithm Solver
## Implemented by Michael Costas 2020

Have you ever wanted to solve something? Are you a fan of Charles Darwin? Well good news, this does the first and is related to the second!

This solution currently uses numpy, python math, and python random. It could likely be implemented without numpy, but requires both the math and random libraries.

Please note that the current format of the files is as such:

- The main.py file stores initial tests
- TestFunctions.py contains the test functions used like beale and Ackley
- GASolver.py is where the magic happens (the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm)
- scipy-tests.py is where I test scipy in comparison with the GA
